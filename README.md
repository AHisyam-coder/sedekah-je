# SedekahJe

this is my today's speedrun project in the office before going home. built using v0 + claude.

had this website idea before when i came across this pdf [list of qr codes for e-derma](https://www.muamalat.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/LIST-OF-QR-CODE-FOR-E-DERMA.pdf).

currently adding mosques from [catqeel](https://x.com/catqeel)'s [twitter thread](https://x.com/catqeel/status/1822939660135645502).

## Sponsor

special thanks to [altaf](https://x.com/danielminho_?s=21&t=uaExBAqkDxtuY8KYLJBCLQ) for sponsoring 2 domains, sedekah-je.com and sedekahje.com. 

## Future Plans

- ocr for extracting all qr codes from the pdf.
- admin panel (?) for public to contribute/ upload qr.
